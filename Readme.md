# Algorithm DS Challenge

## Challenge Start Date : 18 July 2020

I will be daily adding my inteview preparation questions to this repo.
People can refer to it as a reference for Interview Questions.
Thank you for visiting!


### Day-1

1. [BST: Construct BST from given preorder traversal O(n)](../blob/DS/BST/preorder_to_bst.cpp)

2. [BST: Check if a given array can represent Preorder Traversal of Binary Search Tree O(n)](../blob/DS/BST/verify_preorder_for_bst.cpp)

3. [BST: Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree O(log n)](../blob/DS/BST/Lowest_Common_Ancestor.cpp)

4. [BTree: Find minimum and maximum height of Binary Tree](../blob/DS/Binary%20Tree/min_max_depth.cpp)

5. [BTree: Find maximum path sum in Binary Tree](../blob/DS/Binary%20Tree/max_path_sum.cpp)

6. [BTree: Verify if the given tree is full binary tree](../blob/DS/Binary%20Tree/full_binary_tree.cpp)

7. [BTree: Bottom and Top view of binary tree](../blob/DS/Binary%20Tree/bottom_top_view.cpp)

### Day-2

1. [BTree: Remove nodes on root to leaf paths of length < K](../blob/DS/Binary%20Tree/remove_path_less_than_k.cpp)

2. [BTree: Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree](../blob/DS/Binary%20Tree/subtree_or_not.cpp)

3. [String: KMP Search](../blob/Algorithms/String/KMP_Pattern_Detection.cpp)


### TODO

1. You are on an infinite graph and starting from (1, 1), you can move either (x+y, y) or (x, x+y) and you need to find out whether you can reach the given point or not.
